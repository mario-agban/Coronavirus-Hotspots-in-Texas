# Finding Coronavirus Hotspots in Texas

In this project, I use exploratory data analysis and machine learning techniques to examine the contribution of different types of popular venues to the Coronavirus infection rate, and I also score and rank the most "dangerous" types of venues based on my findings.

We analyze:
- Coronavirus Infection Rate Data for Texas Counties (circa June 2020)
- Popular Venue data scraped via the Foursquare API
- Texas County geographical data (used for visualization purposes)
